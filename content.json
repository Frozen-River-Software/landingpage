    "p1": "Frozen River Software started when I realized the tools I was building for myself could help others too. After more than 15 years in the trades ‚Äî electrical, HVAC, and sheet metal ‚Äî I'd had my fair share of job-site inefficiencies. What began as a few scripts and experiments to make my own work easier turned into a growing collection of practical apps for tradespeople, small businesses, and anyone tired of juggling paperwork.",
    "p2": "I've been dabbling in coding, electronics, and automation for over two decades and exploring AI ever since it became public. Frozen River Software is where those interests finally met the real-world experience that shaped them. It's not a big company ‚Äî just me (and a rotating cast of prototypes). But I take pride in building software that actually helps: real-world tested, clearly documented, and crafted with the same care I used to put into every install and service call.",
