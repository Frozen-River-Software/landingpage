    "p1": "Frozen River Software started when I realized the tools I was building for myself could help others too. After more than 15 years in the trades ‚Äî electrical, HVAC, and sheet metal ‚Äî I‚Äôd had my fair share of job-site inefficiencies. What began as a few scripts and experiments to make my own work easier turned into a growing collection of practical apps for tradespeople, small businesses, and anyone tired of juggling paperwork.",
    "p2": "I‚Äôve been dabbling in coding, electronics, and automation for over two decades and exploring AI ever since it became public. Frozen River Software is where those interests finally met the real-world experience that shaped them. It‚Äôs not a big company ‚Äî just me (and a rotating cast of prototypes). But I take pride in building software that actually helps: real-world tested, clearly documented, and crafted with the same care I used to put into every install and service call.",
